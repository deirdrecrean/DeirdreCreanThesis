    <p class="about">This is a site for my thesis. Please check out the songs in my song gallery that I have been working on writing over the past year. Some are good, some are bad, some are weird. All of them made me a better songwriter.</p>

                <p>It is fucking hot outside Wearing sleeves could make me die Ursa thought this as she got dressed To go to school today</p>

                <p>You pull her from examination And write a dress code violation And tell her she should not back talk Then jack off to her in the dark </p>

                <p>She said don’t you know who i am I am my own person Ursa said don’t you know who i am I am in control of my person</p>

                <p>You said send her home for her tank top Credit card clavicles can’t be stopped A vixen who disrupts the class Does not deserve to learn</p>

                <p>She said don’t you know who i am I am my own person Ursa said don’t you know who i am I am in control of my person</p>

                <p>Ursa turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them for the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, And she stared at you with the fire of a woman who's been scorned And you ran for your fucking life while </p>

                <p>She said don’t you know who i am I am my own person Ursa said don’t you know who i am I am in control I am in control I am in control</p>

                <p>Ursa wasn't a normal girl as you could probably see So be careful who you objectify and deny dignity Because these little girls you sexualize might decide to bite back And you’ll be in deep shit then</p>

                <p>Happened again Another victim Brushed off as “wanting attention”</p>

                <p>Courage gets cold When turned into a joke Laughed at by men who won’t ever know</p>

                <p>Have you seen her? Have you seen her? You don’t decide who has hurt her. Have you seen her? Have you seen her? All I know is I believe her.</p>

                <p>You can’t fool me It’s all on TV But it’s nothing that I haven't seen</p>

                <p>Years down the line They’ll wonder why Screaming out to all of us wasn't enough of a sign</p>

                <p>Have you seen her? Have you seen her? You don’t decide who has hurt her. Have you seen her? Have you seen her? All I know is I believe her</p>

                <p>What could possibly be worse than this? Fuck your business and taxes, I don’t care about it Because you put me in danger when you turn a blind eye to this So how could it be worth it?</p>

                <p>I believe her. I believe her. I believe her. I believe her. </p>
                <p>I believe her. I believe her.I believe her. I believe her. </p>
                <p>I believe her. I believe her. I believe her. I believe her. </p>
                <p>I believe her. I believe her. All I know is I believe her.</p>

                <p>I just want to go to sleep but I have five more classes today This paper is done, but God, at what cost?</p>

                <p>cold shower at sunrise I put on a dress to feel alive it’s not that I wanted to look cute I just couldn’t bring myself to put on pants</p>

                <p>sit down to breakfast question my life choices because today</p>

                <p>caffeine necromancy is keeping me animated these bones aren’t mine anymore put one foot in front of the other but feel dead inside live a half life</p>

                <p>they tell me don’t go too hard on the bean but by one pm I’m straight up shaking 55 cent refills just one more cup i will wake the dead</p>

                <p>sit down to take a test i have to take a piss it’s these goddamn diuretics cuz today</p>

                <p>caffeine necromancy keeping me animated it’s the marionette of the zombie that's my soul i tremble at the thought of what it’s doing to my body or maybe i’m just trembling because I'm crashing</p>

                <p>im crashing only five more hours been up for 36 hours only five more hours until i can go to sleep</p>

                <p>because caffeine necromancy is keeping me animated adrenaline and stimulants are doing the work here im involuntarily dragged forward using every ounce of strength that i have or rather, coffee i had</p>

                <p>i don't like to feel this way using drugs to get me through the day but I'll do it again next time there’s an essay</p>

                <p>because why be responsible and sleep?</p>

                <p>The girl sitting next to me on the plane She told me "I don't want to live to see myself become obsolete" I shrug and look down onto the smoggy sky and sprawling city I can already tell I'll get lost in LA So what would it matter </p>

                <p>so It's too dry for me to breathe But I'll make it through the day And the lights don't shine on me But I'm singing anyway It's too dry for me to breathe I'm singing anyway Cuz I'm bursting at the seams I'm bursting at the seams</p>

                <p>I've always tried not to dream too big To set goals that i can achieve that are realistic But everyday it seems more apparent to me that I can and need to do this</p>

                <p>so It's too dry for me to breathe But I'll make it through the day And the lights don't shine on me But I'm singing anyway It's too dry for me to breathe I'm singing anyway Cuz I'm bursting at the seams I'm bursting at the seams</p>

                <p>I step out of the club inspired I want to take on the world like that Leaving it all on the stage poured out for f those who came to see them</p>

                <p>I guess a legacy would be nice But that's not what does it for me</p>

                <p>so It's too dry for me to breathe But I'll make it through the day And the lights don't shine on me But I'm singing anyway It's too dry for me to breathe I'm singing anyway Cuz I'm bursting at the seams I'm bursting at the seams I'm bursting at the seams with the same love that gets you through your days</p>
